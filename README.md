# Scrape and Commet
This webapp lets users scrape articles from [Reuters technology news page](https://www.reuters.com/news/archive/technologyNews).

Articles can be saved (and unsaved), and notes can be added for saved articles.

Articles can also be "cleared". This deletes all saved and unsaved articles, as well as associated notes.

You can access a hosted demo here: <a target="_blank" href="https://scrape-and-comment.herokuapp.com">https://scrape-and-comment.herokuapp.com</a>
